### Short description
>A simple card game with a server side.

### Ruls:
>There is no card on the table, you can play any card (one strength).
>If everyone else folds, the table is cleared and a new round begins.
>
>When the table is occupied, you must play by the following rules:
>The number (number) of cards that you put on the table should be the same.
>The strength of your cards should be higher (that is, the lower the better).
>
>When you have no cards left in your hand, you win the game.
>
>The rank 13 card is a joker card, you can play it with other cards to match the number of cards on the table. There are only two of >them.
